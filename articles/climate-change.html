            <section>
                <p><strong>Climate change</strong> refers to long-term shifts in global or regional climate patterns. Since the mid-20th century, scientists have observed that the primary cause of climate change is human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere.</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Climate change includes both global warming driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases, and the resulting large-scale shifts in weather patterns. Though there have been previous periods of climatic change, since the mid-20th century, humans have had an unprecedented impact on Earth's climate system.</p>

                <h3>Causes</h3>
