            <section>
                <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.</p>

                <h3>Definition and Scope</h3>
                <p>Artificial intelligence is a broad field of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI research has been highly successful in developing effective techniques for solving a wide range of problems, from game playing to medical diagnosis.</p>

                <h3>Types of AI</h3>
